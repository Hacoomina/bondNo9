                with that information. Your visit to the Site is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. Please note <br>
                that this Privacy Policy governs only information provided to Bond No. 9 Online and communications from Bond No. 9 Online. <br>
                It does not govern any other information or communications that may reference Bond No. 9, e.g., <br>
                communications from retailers or brick and mortar stores. This Privacy Policy was last updated 7/10/2008.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information by Bond No. 9 Online</b>
                We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us. For example, <br>
                if you decide to complete a user registration form, complete an online survey or make a purchase, you may be asked <br>
                to provide certain information such as your contact information (name, email address, mailing address, <br>
                and telephone number), age group, gender and product and/or cosmetic concerns. If you decide to place an order, <br>
                \we will also need to know your delivery and billing address, credit card number and expiration date. To protect your personal information, <br>
                users registering at the Site must also enter a user name/email address and password. When you submit <br>
                your personally identifiable information on the Site, you are giving your consent to the collection, <br>
                use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                tracking links and/or similar technology to note some of the pages you visit on our Site and personalize your experience. <br>
                We may also use pixel tags to determine what types of email your browser supports. We may use the information <br>

                you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible. If you have any questions about security at the Site, <br>
